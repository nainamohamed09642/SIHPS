## Idea
1.Nearest E-Waste Facility Locator: Use Geocoding AI to find nearby e-waste facilities based on the user's current location. Implement image recognition to categorize e-waste when users upload photos, suggesting the appropriate recycling facility.

2.Virtual Assistant: Offer a virtual assistant that provides guidance on proper e-waste disposal methods and data wiping techniques for devices with sensitive information.

3.Educational Pop-ups: Display educational pop-ups to raise awareness about the harmful effects of e-waste on the environment and human health.

4.Reward Points System: Introduce a reward points system where users earn points for each e-waste disposal, encouraging participation in recycling programs.

5.Real-time Analytics Dashboard: Provide e-waste facilities with a dashboard showcasing real-time analytics and insights, including recycling rates and energy savings, to help users understand their impact on the environment.
